Source for the Taurus public website hosted at [tauruscmb.com](https://www.tauruscmb.com/).

If you're a member of the Taurus team, feel free to add or edit content in the relevant Markdown (`*.md`) file. The `_people` folder contains the collaborators, please name yourselves as `last_name.md` and include a 200x200 jpg head shot in the `assets/images/people` folder. See `tartakovsky.md` for an example.

The `main` branch _is_ the source for the website so please do not edit it directly. Instead you may edit the `dev` branch or create a pull request with your own branch.

To test the website locally you will need a working installation of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The site can be served locally with:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
and viewed on [localhost:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)
