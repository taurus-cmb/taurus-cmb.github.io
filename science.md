Taurus is a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment optimized to map the \\(E\\)-mode polarization and Galactic foregrounds at the largest angular scales (\\(\ell <\\) 30) and improve measurements of the optical depth to reionization (\\(\tau\\)). This will pave the way for improved measurements of the sum of neutrino masses in combination with high-resolution CMB data as well as test the \\(\Lambda\\)CDM model on large angular scales while also providing high-frequency maps of polarized dust foregrounds to the CMB community. These measurements take advantage of the low-loading environment found in the stratosphere and are enabled by a mid-latitude launch location (Wanaka, NZ), which provides access to 70\% of the sky from NASAâ€™s super-pressure balloon platform. Taurus will employ more than 10,000 100~mK transition edge sensor bolometers distributed across two low-frequency (150, 220 GHz) and one high-frequency (280, 350 GHz) dichroic receivers. The instrument and scan strategy are designed for rigorous control of instrumental systematics, enabling high-fidelity linear polarization measurements on the largest angular scales. The liquid helium cryostat housing the detectors and optics is supported by a lightweight gondola. The payload is designed to meet the challenges in mass, power, and thermal control posed by the super-pressure platform. Here we describe a general overview of Taurus, with an emphasis on the instrument design.
